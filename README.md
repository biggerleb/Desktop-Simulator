# Desktop Simulator
Web app that visually imitate desktop functionality
### What can you do:
* Create files and folders via menu in top-right window corner
* Create files and folders by right-clicking somewhere in the free desktop space
* Drag files and folders all around the place
* Right click on file or folder to open its context-menu
* Double click on file to open its drawing-app-like content
* Double click on folder to open its content
* Folders' and files' content is draggable (folders' is also resizable)
* Play around, discover other functionality and see if everything works as it should
### Built with:
* JQuery mixed with Vanilla Javascript DOM manipulation for DOM manipulation
* Interact.js for making files' and folders' content draggable and resizable (last one refers to folders only)

Yes I know the code is messy, would write it much cleaner now, though
